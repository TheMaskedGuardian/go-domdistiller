                        </h3><p>
                            We’ll work through an example with three local repositories, although in the real world they’d most likely be on three different computers. First, the <tt><span>public</span></tt> repository is where tested, polished changesets live, and it is where you synchronize with the rest of your team.
                        </p><pre>$ hg init public</pre><p>
                            We’ll need two clones where work gets done, <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt> and <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt>:
                        </p><pre>$ hg clone public test-repo
updating to branch default
0 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
$ hg clone test-repo dev-repo
updating to branch default
0 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved</pre><p>
                            <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt> is your local machine, with GUI merge tools and IDEs and everything configured just the way you like it. <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt> is the test server in a rack somewhere behind SSH. So for the most part, we’ll develop in <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt>, push to <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt>, test and polish there, and push to <tt><span>public</span></tt>.
                        </p><p>
                            The key to shared mutable history is to make the target repository, in this case <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt>, non-publishing. And, of course, we have to enable the <tt><span>evolve</span></tt> extension in both <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt> and <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt>.
                        </p><p>
                            First, edit the configuration for <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt>:
                        </p><pre>$ hg -R test-repo config --edit --local</pre><p>
                            and add
                        </p><pre>[phases]
publish = false

[extensions]
evolve =</pre><p>
                            Then edit the configuration for <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt>:
                        </p><pre>$ hg -R dev-repo config --edit --local</pre><p>
                            and add
                        </p><pre>[extensions]
evolve =</pre><p>
                            Keep in mind that in real life, these repositories would probably be on separate computers, so you’d have to login to each one to configure each repository.
                        </p><p>
                            To start things off, let’s make one public, immutable changeset:
                        </p><pre>$ cd test-repo
$ echo &#39;my new project&#39; &gt; file1
$ hg add file1
$ hg commit -m &#39;create new project&#39;
$ hg push
[...]
added 1 changesets with 1 changes to 1 files</pre><p>
                            and pull that into the development repository:
                        </p><pre>$ cd ../dev-repo
$ hg pull -u
[...]
added 1 changesets with 1 changes to 1 files
1 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved</pre><h3>
                            <a href="#id8">Example 1: Amend a shared changeset</a><a href="#example-1-amend-a-shared-changeset" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
                        </h3><p>
                            Everything you learned in the <a href="user-guide.html">user guide</a> applies to work done in <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt>. You can commit, amend, uncommit, evolve, and so forth just as before.
                        </p><p>
                            Things get different when you push changesets to <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt>. Or rather, things stay the same, which <em>is</em> different: because we configured <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt> to be non-publishing, draft changesets stay draft when we push them to <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt>. Importantly, they’re also draft (mutable) in <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt>.
                        </p><p>
                            Let’s commit a preliminary change and push it to <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt> for testing.
                        </p><pre>$ echo &#39;fix fix fix&#39; &gt; file1
$ hg commit -m &#39;prelim change&#39;
$ hg push ../test-repo</pre><p>
                            At this point, <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt> and <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt> have the same changesets in the same phases:
                        </p><blockquote><div>
                                [figure SG01: rev 0:0dc9 public, rev 1:f649 draft, same on both repos]
                            </div></blockquote><p>
                            (You may notice a change in notation from the user guide: now changesets are labelled with their revision number and the first four digits of the 40-digit hexadecimal changeset ID. Mercurial revision numbers are never stable when working across repositories, especially when obsolescence is involved. We’ll see why shortly.)
                        </p><p>
                            Now let’s switch to <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt> to test our change:
                        </p><pre>$ cd ../test-repo
$ hg update</pre><p>
                            Don’t forget to <tt><span>hg</span> <span>update</span></tt>! Pushing only adds changesets to a remote repository; it does not update the working directory (unless you have a hook that updates for you).
                        </p><p>
                            Now let’s imagine the tests failed because we didn’t use proper punctuation and capitalization (oops). Let’s amend our preliminary fix (and fix the lame commit message while we’re at it):
                        </p><pre>$ echo &#39;Fix fix fix.&#39; &gt; file1
$ hg amend -m &#39;fix bug 37&#39;</pre><p>
                            Now we’re in a funny intermediate state (figure 2): revision 1:f649 is obsolete in <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt>, having been replaced by revision 3:60ff (revision 2:2a03 is another one of those temporary amend commits that we saw in the user guide)—but <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt> knows nothing of these recent developments.
                        </p><blockquote><div>
                                [figure SG02: test-repo has rev 0:0dc9 public, rev 1:f649, 2:2a03 obsolete, rev 3:60ff draft; dev-repo same as in SG01]
                            </div></blockquote><p>
                            Let’s resynchronize:
                        </p><pre>$ cd ../dev-repo
$ hg pull -u
[...]
added 1 changesets with 1 changes to 1 files (+1 heads)
1 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved</pre><p>
                            As seen in figure 3, this transfers the new changeset <em>and</em> the obsolescence marker for revision 1. However, it does <em>not</em> transfer the temporary amend commit, because it is hidden. Push and pull transfer obsolescence markers between repositories, but they do not transfer hidden changesets.
                        </p><blockquote><div>
                                [figure SG03: dev-repo grows new rev 2:60ff, marks 1:f649 obsolete]
                            </div></blockquote><p>
                            Because of this deliberately incomplete synchronization, revision numbers in <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt> and <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt> are no longer consistent. We <em>must</em> use changeset IDs.
                        </p><h3>
                            <a href="#id9">Example 2: Amend again, locally</a><a href="#example-2-amend-again-locally" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
                        </h3><p>
                            This process can repeat. Perhaps you figure out a more elegant fix to the bug, and want to mutate history so nobody ever knows you had a less-than-perfect idea. We’ll implement it locally in <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt> and push to <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt>:
                        </p><pre>$ echo &#39;Fix, fix, and fix.&#39; &gt; file1
$ hg amend
$ hg push</pre><p>
                            This time around, the temporary amend commit is in <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt>, and it is not transferred to <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt>—the same as before, just in the opposite direction. Figure 4 shows the two repositories after amending in <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt> and pushing to <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt>.
                        </p><blockquote><div>
                                [figure SG04: each repo has one temporary amend commit, but they’re different in each one]
                            </div></blockquote><p>
                            Let’s hop over to <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt> to test the more elegant fix:
                        </p><pre>$ cd ../test-repo
$ hg update
1 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved</pre><p>
                            This time, all the tests pass, so no further amending is required. This bug fix is finished, so we push it to the public repository:
                        </p><pre>$ hg push
[...]
added 1 changesets with 1 changes to 1 files</pre><p>
                            Note that only one changeset—the final version, after two amendments—was actually pushed. Again, Mercurial doesn’t transfer hidden changesets on push and pull.
                        </p><p>
                            So the picture in <tt><span>public</span></tt> is much simpler than in either <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt> or <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt>. Neither of our missteps nor our amendments are publicly visible, just the final, beautifully polished changeset:
                        </p><blockquote><div>
                                [figure SG05: public repo with rev 0:0dc9, 1:de61, both public]
                            </div></blockquote><p>
                            There is one important step left to do. Because we pushed from <tt><span>test-repo</span></tt> to <tt><span>public</span></tt>, the pushed changeset is in <em>public</em> phase in those two repositories. But <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt> has been out-of-the-loop; changeset de61 is still <em>draft</em> there. If we’re not careful, we might mutate history in <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt>, obsoleting a changeset that is already public. Let’s avoid that situation for now by pushing up to <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt>:
                        </p><pre>$ hg push ../dev-repo
pushing to ../dev-repo
searching for changes
no changes found</pre><p>
                            Even though no <em>changesets</em> were pushed, Mercurial still pushed obsolescence markers and phase changes to <tt><span>dev-repo</span></tt>.
                        </p><p>
                            A final note: since this fix is now <em>public</em>, it is immutable. It’s no longer possible to amend it:
                        </p><pre>$ hg amend -m &#39;fix bug 37&#39;
abort: cannot amend public changesets</pre><p>
                            This is, after all, the whole point of Mercurial’s phases: to prevent rewriting history that has already been published.
                        </p><p>
                        Code review is a good use case for sharing mutable history across multiple developers: Alice commits a draft changeset, submits it for review, and amends her changeset until her reviewer is satisfied. Meanwhile, Bob is also committing draft changesets for review, amending until his reviewer is satisfied. Once a particular changeset passes review, the respective author (Alice or Bob) pushes it to the public (publishing) repository.
                    </p><p>
                        Incidentally, the reviewers here can be anyone: maybe Bob and Alice review each other’s work; maybe the same third party reviews both; or maybe they pick different experts to review their work on different parts of a large codebase. Similarly, it doesn’t matter if reviews are conducted in person, by email, or by carrier pigeon. Code review is outside of the scope of Mercurial, so all we’re looking at here is the mechanics of committing, amending, pushing, and pulling.

                            We need to configure Alice’s and Bob’s working repositories to enable <tt><span>evolve</span></tt>. First, edit Alice’s configuration with
                        </p><pre>$ hg -R alice config --edit --local</pre><p>
                            and add
                        </p><pre>[extensions]
evolve =</pre><p>
                            Then edit Bob’s repository configuration:
                        </p><pre>$ hg -R bob config --edit --local</pre><p>
                            and add the same text.
                        </p><h3>
                            <a href="#id12">Example 3: Alice commits and amends a draft fix</a><a href="#example-3-alice-commits-and-amends-a-draft-fix" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
                        </h3><p>
                            We’ll follow Alice working on a bug fix. We’re going to use bookmarks to make it easier to understand multiple branch heads in the <tt><span>review</span></tt> repository, so Alice starts off by creating a bookmark and committing her first attempt at a fix:
                        </p><pre>$ hg bookmark bug15
$ echo &#39;fix&#39; &gt; file2
$ hg commit -A -u alice -m &#39;fix bug 15 (v1)&#39;
adding file2</pre><p>
                            Note the unorthodox “(v1)” in the commit message. We’re just using that to make this tutorial easier to follow; it’s not something we’d recommend in real life.
                        </p><p>
                            Of course Alice wouldn’t commit unless her fix worked to her satisfaction, so it must be time to solicit a code review. She does this by pushing to the <tt><span>review</span></tt> repository:
                        </p><pre>$ hg push -B bug15
[...]
added 1 changesets with 1 changes to 1 files
exporting bookmark bug15</pre><p>
                            (The use of <tt><span>-B</span></tt> is important to ensure that we only push the bookmarked head, and that the bookmark itself is pushed. See this <a href="http://mercurial.aragost.com/kick-start/en/bookmarks/">guide to bookmarks</a>, especially the <a href="http://mercurial.aragost.com/kick-start/en/bookmarks/#sharing-bookmarks">Sharing Bookmarks</a> section, if you’re not familiar with bookmarks.)
                        </p><p>
                            Some time passes, and Alice receives her code review. As a result, Alice revises her fix and submits it for a second review:
                        </p><pre>$ echo &#39;Fix.&#39; &gt; file2
$ hg amend -m &#39;fix bug 15 (v2)&#39;

                            Figure 6 shows the state of the <tt><span>review</span></tt> repository at this point.

                            After a busy morning of bug fixing, Alice stops for lunch. Let’s see what Bob has been up to.
                        </p><h3>
                            <a href="#id13">Example 4: Bob implements and publishes a new feature</a><a href="#example-4-bob-implements-and-publishes-a-new-feature" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a>
                        </h3><p>
                            Meanwhile, Bob has been working on a new feature. Like Alice, he’ll use a bookmark to track his work, and he’ll push that bookmark to the <tt><span>review</span></tt> repository, so that reviewers know which changesets to review.
                        </p><pre>$ cd ../bob
$ echo &#39;stuff&#39; &gt; file1

[...]

                            When Bob receives his code review, he improves his implementation a bit, amends, and submits the resulting changeset for review:
                        </p><pre>$ echo &#39;do stuff&#39; &gt; file1
$ hg amend -m &#39;implement feature X (v2)&#39;                  # rev 5:0eb7
$ hg push
[...]
added 1 changesets with 1 changes to 1 files (+1 heads)
updating bookmark featureX</pre><p>
                            Unfortunately, that still doesn’t pass muster. Bob’s reviewer insists on proper capitalization and punctuation.
                        </p><pre>$ echo &#39;Do stuff.&#39; &gt; file1
$ hg amend -m &#39;implement feature X (v3)&#39;                  # rev 6:540b</pre><p>
                            On the bright side, the second review said, “Go ahead and publish once you fix that.” So Bob immediately publishes his third attempt:
                        </p><pre>$ hg push ../public
[...]
added 1 changesets with 1 changes to 1 files</pre><p>
                            It’s not enough just to update <tt><span>public</span></tt>, though! Other people also use the <tt><span>review</span></tt> repository, and right now it doesn’t have Bob’s latest amendment (“v3”, revision 6:540b), nor does it know that the precursor of that changeset (“v2”, revision 5:0eb7) is obsolete. Thus, Bob pushes to <tt><span>review</span></tt> as well:
                        </p><pre>$ hg push ../review
[...]
added 1 changesets with 1 changes to 1 files (+1 heads)
updating bookmark featureX</pre><p>
                            Figure 7 shows the result of Bob’s work in both <tt><span>review</span></tt> and <tt><span>public</span></tt>.
                        </p><blockquote><div>

                            Incidentally, it’s important that Bob push to <tt><span>public</span></tt> <em>before</em> <tt><span>review</span></tt>. If he pushed to <tt><span>review</span></tt> first, then revision 6:540b would still be in <em>draft</em> phase in <tt><span>review</span></tt>, but it would be <em>public</em> in both Bob’s local repository and the <tt><span>public</span></tt> repository. That could lead to confusion at some point, which is easily avoided by pushing first to <tt><span>public</span></tt>.

                            Finally, Alice gets back from lunch and sees that the carrier pigeon with her second review has arrived (or maybe it’s in her email inbox). Alice’s reviewer approved her amended changeset, so she pushes it to <tt><span>public</span></tt>:

                            Oops! Bob has won the race to push first to <tt><span>public</span></tt>. So Alice needs to integrate with Bob: let’s pull his changeset(s) and see what the branch heads are.

                            We’ll assume Alice and Bob are perfectly comfortable with rebasing changesets. (After all, they’re already using mutable history in the form of <tt><span>amend</span></tt>.) So Alice rebases her changeset on top of Bob’s and publishes the result:

                            When an obsolete changeset has two successors, those successors are <em>divergent</em>. One way to get into such a situation is by failing to communicate with your teammates. Let’s see how that might happen.
                        </p><p>
                            First, we’ll have Bob commit a bug fix that could still be improved:
                        </p><pre>$ cd bob
$ echo &#39;pretty good fix&#39; &gt;&gt; file1
$ hg commit -u bob -m &#39;fix bug 24 (v1)&#39;                   # rev 4:2fe6</pre><p>
                            Since Alice and Bob are now in cowboy mode, Alice pulls Bob’s draft changeset and amends it herself.
                        </p><pre>$ cd ../alice
$ hg pull -u ../bob
[...]
added 1 changesets with 1 changes to 1 files
$ echo &#39;better fix (alice)&#39; &gt;&gt; file1
$ hg amend -u alice -m &#39;fix bug 24 (v2 by alice)&#39;</pre><p>
                            But Bob has no idea that Alice just did this. (See how important good communication is?) So he implements a better fix of his own:
                        </p><pre>$ cd ../bob
$ echo &#39;better fix (bob)&#39; &gt;&gt; file1
$ hg amend -u bob -m &#39;fix bug 24 (v2 by bob)&#39;             # rev 6:a360</pre><p>
                            At this point, the divergence exists, but only in theory: Bob’s original changeset, 4:2fe6, is obsolete and has two successors. But those successors are in different repositories, so the trouble is not visible to anyone yet. It will be as soon as Bob pulls from Alice’s repository (or vice-versa).
                        </p><pre>$ hg pull ../alice
[...]
added 1 changesets with 1 changes to 2 files (+1 heads)
(run &#39;hg heads&#39; to see heads, &#39;hg merge&#39; to merge)

                            Figure 9 shows the situation in Bob’s repository.

                            Now we need to get out of trouble. As usual, the answer is to evolve history.

                            We carefully dodged a merge conflict by specifying a merge tool (<tt><span>internal:other</span></tt>) that will take Alice’s changes over Bob’s.

He’s avoiding a <a href="#bug">bug</a> in <tt><span>evolve</span></tt> that occurs when evolving divergent changesets using <tt><span>internal:local</span></tt>.)

                            If Alice and Bob are collaborating on some mutable changesets, it’s possible to get into a situation where an otherwise worthwhile changeset cannot be pushed to the public repository; it is <em>phase-divergent</em> with another changeset that was made public first. Let’s demonstrate one way this could happen.
                        </p><p>
                            It starts with Alice committing a bug fix. Right now, we don’t yet know if this bug fix is good enough to push to the public repository, but it’s good enough for Alice to commit.
                        </p><pre>$ cd alice
$ echo &#39;fix&#39; &gt; file2
$ hg commit -A -m &#39;fix bug 15&#39;

                            Now Bob has a bad idea: he decides to pull whatever Alice is working on and tweak her bug fix to his taste:
                        </p><pre>$ cd ../bob
$ hg pull -u ../alice

$ echo &#39;Fix.&#39; &gt; file2
$ hg amend -A -m &#39;fix bug 15 (amended)&#39;</pre><p>
                            (Note the lack of communication between Alice and Bob. Failing to communicate with your colleagues is a good way to get into trouble. Nevertheless, <tt><span>evolve</span></tt> can usually sort things out, as we will see.)
                        </p><blockquote><div>
                                [figure SG06: Bob’s repo with one amendment]
                            </div></blockquote><p>
                            After some testing, Alice realizes her bug fix is just fine as it is: no need for further polishing and amending, this changeset is ready to publish.
                        </p><pre>$ cd ../alice
$ hg push
[...]
added 1 changesets with 1 changes to 1 files</pre><p>
                            This introduces a contradiction: in Bob’s repository, changeset 2:e011 (his copy of Alice’s fix) is obsolete, since Bob amended it. But in Alice’s repository (and the <tt><span>public</span></tt> repository), that changeset is public: it is immutable, carved in stone for all eternity. No changeset can be both obsolete and public, so Bob is in for a surprise the next time he pulls from <tt><span>public</span></tt>:
                        </p><pre>$ cd ../bob
$ hg pull -q -u
1 new phase-divergent changesets</pre><p>
                            Figure 7 shows what just happened to Bob’s repository: changeset 2:e011 is now public, so it can’t be obsolete. When that changeset was obsolete, it made perfect sense for it to have a successor, namely Bob’s amendment of Alice’s fix (changeset 4:fe88). But it’s illogical for a public changeset to have a successor, so 4:fe88 is troubled: it has become <em>bumped</em>.
                        </p><blockquote><div>
                                [figure SG07: 2:e011 now public not obsolete, 4:fe88 now bumped]
                            </div></blockquote><p>
                            As usual when there’s trouble in your repository, the solution is to evolve it:
                        </p><pre>$ hg evolve --all</pre><p>
                            Figure 8 illustrates Bob’s repository after evolving away the bumped changeset. Ignoring the obsolete changesets, Bob now has a nice, clean, simple history. His amendment of Alice’s bug fix lives on, as changeset 5:227d—albeit with a software-generated commit message. (Bob should probably amend that changeset to improve the commit message.) But the important thing is that his repository no longer has any troubled changesets, thanks to <tt><span>evolve</span></tt>.
                        </p><blockquote><div>
                                [figure SG08: 5:227d is new, formerly bumped changeset 4:fe88 now hidden]

                        Mutable history shared across multiple repositories by a single developer is a natural extension of this model. Once you are used to using a single sharp knife on its own, it’s pretty straightforward to chop onions and mushrooms using the same knife, or to alternate between two chopping boards with different knives.
                    </p><p>
                        Mutable history shared by multiple developers is a scary place to go. Imagine a professional kitchen full of expert chefs tossing their favourite knives back and forth, with the occasional axe or chainsaw thrown in to spice things up. If you’re confident that you <em>and your colleagues</em> can do it without losing a limb, go for it. But be sure to practice a lot first before you rely on it!

They’re also costly for mom and dad.</p><p>The average cost of a graduation party in 2013 was a whopping $1,200, according to Graduationparty.com; $700 of that was allocated for food. However that budget was based on Midwestern statistics, and parties in urban areas like New York City are thought to have a much higher price tag.</p><p>Thankfully, there are plenty of creative ways to trim a little grad party fat without sacrificing any of the fun or celebratory spirit.</p><figure><img src="//img-aws.ehowcdn.com/640/cme/cme_public_images/www_ehow_com/cdn-write.demandstudios.com/upload/image/2F/86/5547EF62-EAF5-4256-945D-0496F61C862F/5547EF62-EAF5-4256-945D-0496F61C862F.jpg" alt="Graduation" title="Graduation"/></figure><figcaption class="caption">

But that convenience comes with a price tag. A country club may charge as much as $2,000 for room rental and restaurant food and beverage will almost always cost more than food prepped and served at home.</p><figure><img src="//img-aws.ehowcdn.com/640/cme/cme_public_images/www_ehow_com/cdn-write.demandstudios.com/upload/image/FE/CB/121569D2-6984-4B2F-83C4-9D2D9A27CBFE/121569D2-6984-4B2F-83C4-9D2D9A27CBFE.jpg" alt="Save money hosting the party at home."/></figure><figcaption class="caption">

Both easily hook up to most speakers or mp3 compatible docks to play music from your music library. Or download Pandora, the free online radio app, and play hours of music for free.</p><p>Personalize the music with a playlist of the grad’s favorite songs or songs that were big hits during his or her years in school.</p><figure><img src="//img-aws.ehowcdn.com/640/cme/cme_public_images/www_ehow_com/cdn-write.demandstudios.com/upload/image/DF/FC/A05B0252-BD73-4BC7-A09A-96F0A504FCDF/A05B0252-BD73-4BC7-A09A-96F0A504FCDF.jpg" alt="Online radio can take the place of a hired DJ."/></figure><figcaption class="caption">

Serve pitchers of tap water with lemon and cucumber slices or sliced strawberries for an interesting and refreshing flavor. Opt for punches and non-alcoholic drinks for high school graduates that allow guests to dole out the exact amount they want to drink.</p><figure><img src="//img-aws.ehowcdn.com/640/cme/cme_public_images/www_ehow_com/cdn-write.demandstudios.com/upload/image/EB/DB/8A04CCA7-3255-4225-B59A-C41441F8DBEB/8A04CCA7-3255-4225-B59A-C41441F8DBEB.jpg" alt="Serve drinks in pitchers, not in cans."/></figure><figcaption class="caption">
            evgenyb/iStock/Getty Images </figcaption><p>Instead of inviting everyone you – and the graduate – know or ever knew, scale back the guest list. Forgo inviting guests that you or your grad haven&#39;t seen for eons. There is no reason to provide provisions for people who are essentially out of your lives. Sticking to a small, but personal, guest list allows more time to mingle with loved ones during the party, too.</p><figure><img src="//img-aws.ehowcdn.com/640/cme/cme_public_images/www_ehow_com/cdn-write.demandstudios.com/upload/image/94/10/08035476-0167-4A03-AADC-13A7E7AA1094/08035476-0167-4A03-AADC-13A7E7AA1094.jpg" alt="Limit guests to those close to the graduate."/></figure><figcaption class="caption">

You can split some of the expenses, especially when the two graduates share mutual friends. You&#39;ll also have another parent to bounce ideas off of and to help you stick to your budget when you&#39;re tempted to splurge.</p><figure><img src="//img-aws.ehowcdn.com/640/cme/cme_public_images/www_ehow_com/cdn-write.demandstudios.com/upload/image/06/49/4AD62696-FC95-4DA2-8351-42740C7B4906/4AD62696-FC95-4DA2-8351-42740C7B4906.jpg" alt="Throw a joint bash for big savings."/></figure><figcaption class="caption">

Instead, serve some of the graduate&#39;s favorite side dishes that are cost effective, like a big pot of spaghetti with breadsticks. Opt for easy and simple food such as pizza, finger food and mini appetizers. </p><p>Avoid pre-packaged foods and pre-made deli platters. These can be quite costly. Instead, make your own cheese and deli platters for less than half the cost of pre-made.</p><figure><img src="//img-aws.ehowcdn.com/640/cme/cme_public_images/www_ehow_com/cdn-write.demandstudios.com/upload/image/D0/51/B6AED06C-5E19-4A26-9AAD-0E175F6251D0/B6AED06C-5E19-4A26-9AAD-0E175F6251D0.jpg" alt="Cost effective appetizers are just as satisfying as pre-made deli platters."/></figure><figcaption class="caption">

Guests also tend to consume less alcohol in the middle of the day, which keeps cost down.</p><figure><img src="//img-aws.ehowcdn.com/640/cme/cme_public_images/www_ehow_com/cdn-write.demandstudios.com/upload/image/35/B4/DD5FD05A-B631-4AFE-BC8F-FDACAD1EB435/DD5FD05A-B631-4AFE-BC8F-FDACAD1EB435.jpg" alt="A brunch gathering will cost less than a dinner party."/></figure><figcaption class="caption">

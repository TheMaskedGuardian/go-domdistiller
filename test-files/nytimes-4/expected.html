                                                The federal government could soon pay more in interest on its debt than it spends on the military, Medicaid or children’s programs.

                                                The run-up in borrowing costs is a one-two punch brought on by the need to finance a fast-growing budget deficit, worsened by tax cuts and steadily rising interest rates that will make the debt more expensive.
                                            </p><p>
                                                With less money coming in and more going toward interest, political leaders will find it harder to address pressing needs like fixing crumbling roads and bridges or to make emergency moves like pulling the economy out of future recessions.
                                            </p><p>
                                                Within a decade, more than $900 billion in interest payments will be due annually, easily outpacing spending on myriad other programs. Already the fastest-growing major government expense, the cost of interest is on track to hit $390 billion next year, nearly 50 percent more than in 2017, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

                                                “It’s very much something to worry about,” said C. Eugene Steuerle, a fellow at the Urban Institute and a co-founder of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington. “Everything else is getting squeezed.”
                                            </p><p>
                                                Gradually rising interest rates would have made borrowing more expensive even without additional debt. But the tax cuts passed late last year have created a deeper hole, with the deficit increasing faster than expected. A budget bill <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/us/politics/congress-budget-deal-vote.html?module=inline" title="">approved in February that raised</a> spending by $300 billion over two years will add to the financial pressure.

                                                The deficit is expected to total nearly $1 trillion next year — the first time it has been that big since 2012, when the economy was still struggling to recover from the financial crisis and interest rates were near zero.
                                            </p><p>
                                                    Annual interest payments on the national debt are expected to triple over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

                                                Deficit hawks have gone silent, even proposing changes that would exacerbate the deficit. House Republicans introduced legislation this month that would make the tax cuts permanent.

                                                “The issue has just disappeared,” said Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat. “There’s collective amnesia.”

                                                The combination, say economists, marks a journey into mostly uncharted financial territory.

                                                In the past, government borrowing expanded during recessions and waned in recoveries. That countercyclical policy has been a part of the standard Keynesian toolbox to combat downturns since the Great Depression.
                                            </p><p>
                                                The deficit is soaring now as the economy booms, meaning the stimulus is pro-cyclical. The risk is that the government would have less room to maneuver if the economy slows.

                                                    Debt as a percentage of gross domestic product tends to increase during recessions and fall during recoveries. But the debt is increasing now, even as the economy is growing, because of tax cuts and spending increases.

                                                Aside from wartime or a deep downturn like the 1930s or 2008-9, “this sort of aggressive fiscal stimulus is unprecedented in U.S. history,” said Jeffrey Frankel, an economist at Harvard.

                                                Pouring gasoline on an already hot economy has resulted in faster growth — the economy expanded at an annualized rate of 4.2 percent in the second quarter. But Mr. Frankel warns that when the economy weakens, the government will find it more difficult to cut taxes or increase spending.

                                                Lawmakers might, in fact, feel compelled to cut spending as tax revenue falls, further depressing the economy. “There will eventually be another recession, and this increases the chances we will have to slam on the brakes when the car is already going too slowly,” Mr. Frankel said.

                                                    Interest payments will make up 13 percent of the federal budget a decade from now, surpassing spending on Medicaid and defense.

                                                Finding the money to pay investors who hold government debt will crimp other parts of the budget. In a decade, interest on the debt will eat up 13 percent of government spending, up from 6.6 percent in 2017.

                                                “By 2020, we will spend more on interest than we do on kids, including education, food stamps and aid to families,” said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a research and advocacy organization.

                                                Interest costs already dwarf spending on many popular programs. For example, grants to students from low-income families for college total roughly $30 billion — about one-tenth of what the government will pay in interest this year. Interest payments will overtake Medicaid in 2020 and the Department of Defense budget in 2023.

                                                What’s more, the heavy burden of interest payments could make it harder for the government to repair aging infrastructure or take on other big new projects.

                                                Mr. Trump has called for spending $1 trillion on infrastructure, but Congress has not taken up that idea.

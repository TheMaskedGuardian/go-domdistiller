<p>Glass cloche terrariums are not only appealing to the eye, but they also preserve a bit of nature in your home and serve as a simple, yet beautiful, piece of art. Closed terrariums are easy to care for, as they retain much of their own moisture and provide a warm environment with a consistent level of humidity. You won’t have to water the terrariums unless you see that the walls are not misting up. Small growing plants that don’t require a lot of light work best such as succulents, ferns, moss, even orchids.</p><figure><img src="http://img-aws.ehowcdn.com/640/cme/photography.prod.demandstudios.com/16149374-814f-40bc-baf3-ca20f149f0ba.jpg" alt="Glass cloche terrariums" title="Glass cloche terrariums"/></figure>

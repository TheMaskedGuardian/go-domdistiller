The study determined this by taking the ratio of employed men and women between the ages of 25 and 54 compared to the total population of each country. </p><p> The overall rankings of the countries were as follows:<span> <br/>1. Finland <span> <br/>2. Norway<span> <br/>3. Australia <span> <br/>4. Canada<span> <br/>5. Germany<span> <br/>6. France<span> <br/>7. United Kingdom <span> <br/>8. Italy<span> <br/>9. Spain<span> <br/>10. United States </span></span>

                            </p><p> The low ranking the U.S. received was due to its extreme levels of wealth and income inequality and the ineffectiveness of its &#34;safety net&#34; -- social programs aimed at reducing poverty. </p><p> The report concluded that the American safety net was ineffective because it provides only half the financial help people need. Additionally, the levels of assistance in the U.S. are generally lower than in other countries. </p><div> <span> CNNMoney (New York) </span> <span>First published February 1, 2016: 1:28 AM ET</span> </div>
